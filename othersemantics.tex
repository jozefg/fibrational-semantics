\section{Fibrational Semantics Compared to Other Approaches}

In the wide world of categorical semantics its worthwhile to pause and
ask what distinguishes fibrational semantics as a useful tool.
This section examines a few other common category theoretic tools used
modeling type theories and discusses their relationship to fibrations.

Perhaps the mostly widely used structure for modeling simple type
theories is a closed cartesian category. In fact in this scenario I
would expect fibrations to be a limited utility. There is not a
complicated indexing or dependency structure in this logic. Therefore,
having high powered machinery for handling indexing is simply a
waste. In fact, for any propositional logic or type theory without
type dependency of some sort fibrations are not nearly as useful. In
this sense, fibrations are incomparable to CCCs and similar tools.

A more interesting example is that of locally cartesian closed
categories. These categories provide models of Martin-L\"of Type
Theory~\cite{MartinLof:84}.
\begin{defn}\label{defn:othersemantics:lccc}
  A locally cartesian category $\mathcal{E}$ is a category where each
  slice category is cartesian closed. Equivalently, the reindexing
  functor $f^*$ has both a left and right adjoint.
\end{defn}
Under the LCCC methodology, contexts are interpreted as objects in the
category and types are interpreted as slices over their contexts.
\[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    \denote{\Gamma, A} \ar[d, "\denote{A}"]\\
    \denote{\Gamma}
  \end{tikzcd}
\]
The cartesian closer of the slice categories means that we can form
function types using exponentials and quantification is interpreted by
the various adjoints to $f^*$ under the quantifiers are adjoints
slogan. However, LCCCs are a strict special case of fibrations. They
are simply categories for which the $\cod$ fibration is a fiberwise
CCC~\ref{defn:fibrations:fiberwiseX} or equivalently that it has
products and coproducts~\ref{defn:fibrations:products}. By relaxing
the particular fibration we require this definition generalizes
LCCCs. A direct fibrational generalization of LCCCs to capture models
of Martin-L\"of type theory are comprehension
categories~\cite{Jacobs:93}. These are functors $P : \Ecat \to
\Bcat^{\to}$ so that $\cod \circ P$ forms a fibration. By postulating
various simple properties about this fibration this forms a model of
type theory.
